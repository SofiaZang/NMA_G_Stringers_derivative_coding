# NMA_G_Stringers_derivative_coding
This is our NeuroMatch Impact Scholars Project. We analyse spontaneous and evoked V1 mouse population imaging data and behaviour - our goal is to check how current value (variable) and change value (derivative of the variable) are encoded in the mouse V1 network.
